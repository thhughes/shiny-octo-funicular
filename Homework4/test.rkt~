;; Testing Pass by value vs. Pass by reference:
(with ([x 1][y 2])
      (seq (with ([f (fun (z) (set z 10))])
                 (f y))
           (+ x y)))
;; If this is PFV : Returns 3
;; If this is PBR : Returns 11


;; Attempt at figuring out dynamic vs. static scope:
(with ([f2 (fun (y) (+ x y))])
      (with ([f1 (fun (x))])
            (f1 3)))

(with ([x 1])
      (with ([foo (fun (y) (+ x y))])
            (with ([x 2])
                  (foo 10))))
