:: Questions:

- How does the environment update such that it knows what came before it if we're passing an empty environment?
- Can we talk about how functions definitions should look and how they are called in our language?
- Type cases? what is going on there...
- Why toes the interp being passed in the example stuff not have a list of functions?
      --- Do those get included in the Env?
