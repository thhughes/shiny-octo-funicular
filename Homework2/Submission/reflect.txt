Peer review from the tests did not really impact my code. However, I did find that talking with my peers about the project and talking about the ideas and the types that were being passed around to be very helpful. Personally, I would really apprecate a peer review on this assignment (not just the tests) to see how others are doing this part of the code. There were helper functions and things that I included in my interpretation that I would love to see how other people do it. On a sepparate note, I wasn't really sure how/what the guidelines were for what to include in the submission files. After talking to other students i'm pretty sure what I have is correct. However, I would have appreciated a 'sample' submission with dummie functions just to point out explicitly what you want where.
